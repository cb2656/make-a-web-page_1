        HTML Documents consist of: Doctype HTML, Opening HTML, Head,Body,content, body, closing HTML.
        </p>          
 <h2>Lesson Two: Creating a Structured document with HTML</h2> 
    <p>Think of it like a house.  <b>HTML</B>=structure, <b>CSS</b>=style and <b>Java Script</b>=interactive components.
  </p>
 <div class="Quiz">
  <p>
    <b>Quiz Question:</b> Observing Wikipedia's Page by Structure, which of the following are true?
   <p>--All elements are visible<br>--All elements are Rectangular  <b>X</b><br>--You can read the same text as on the page.<b>X</b>
  </div>
<div>
  <p><b>Tree like Structure</b>
  <p>Using multiple elements "tags" like div, h2 etc, you can see how each one nests in the previous one.</p>
  <p>
  <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> are languages--syntax & Rules.  From HTML Language you get "Tag"--elements in the tree, which make up the <b>DOM</b><em> Document Object model</em>
  </p>
</div>
  <p>
    <b>Boxes Everywhere</b>
</p>
  By unchecking the <em> Border Radius</em> the circle became a square.<br>By clicking on the shape,right clicking and selecting <em>"inspect element"</em> the <b>element box</b> and <b>style</b> box appear where you can make changes.
  <p>
    <b>Boxes to HTML</b>
</p>
  Transfer a webpage to HTML using "div" tags
<p>
<h2> Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets.</em> An Important idea is known as:
    <br><b><em>Inheritance </em></b> and understanding it requires abstract thinking.
    <p>There are many selections for CSS Selectors; using the Mozilla CSS Reference.
    <br>--H1 is a selector and by using curly braces after and at the bottom, everything inbetween is the "rule."
    <br> The line of code that says <b>background-color : black;</b> is a <em>declaration.</em> background-color is a <em>property</em> and black is the value of that property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since everything on the web is in boxes, structure within the boxes is key. Elements within elements creates a structured 'box-like' model of a web page.  The "Divs" and "Spans" help to build the structure also.  
  <p>
    Avoiding repetition is very important. By copying and pasting the same code with minor diferences you open yourself up to potential Errors.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Box Sizing:
    <br >There are four main points about box sizing.
    <br> --HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
    <br> --There are so many components to each box, it can be hard to get the size of a box right.
    <br> --There are two techniques to help deal with sizing issues.
    <br> --Different browsers work differently. So,different browsers can display the same code differently.
  </p> 
    <p> Box positioning:
    <br>Adding the rule "display: flex; to the right CSS will let the "divs" appear next to each other.
    </p>
  <p>CODE, TEST, REFINE
    <br>The structure of the page needs to be right.  Look for Natural boxes. 
    <br>If it needs to be a heading, make it so, then the size of the boxes.  Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.
